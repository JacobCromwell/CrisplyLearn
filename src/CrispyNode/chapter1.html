      <h1>Chapter 1: Introduction to Node.js</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the first chapter of our Node.js book! In this chapter, we'll introduce you to the basics of Node.js and explain what it is, how it works, and why it's so useful for building web applications.</p>
      <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
      <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to write server-side code in JavaScript, which means you can use a single programming language (JavaScript) for both your front-end and back-end code. This is great because it eliminates the need to learn a separate language or framework for server-side programming.</p>
      <h2>How does Node.js work?</h2>
      <p>Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. When a request comes in to a Node.js server, it doesn't block the thread until the request is finished. Instead, it executes the request in a callback function and moves on to the next request. When the first request finishes, it invokes the callback function associated with that request and sends the response back to the client.</p>
      <h2>Why use Node.js?</h2>
      <p>There are several reasons why Node.js is a great choice for building web applications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Node.js is fast and lightweight, making it ideal for building scalable web applications that can handle large amounts of traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> If you already know JavaScript, you can use that knowledge to build both your front-end and back-end code, which can save you time and reduce the learning curve.</li>
        <li><strong>Package ecosystem:</strong> Node.js has a vast ecosystem of packages and modules available on npm, which can help you quickly add functionality to your application without having to reinvent the wheel.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Project Setup</h2>
      <p>In order to create your first node project you will need to install both node and npm. I strongly recommend using <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating">nvm</a> to install and manage both.</p>
      <p>After installing node and npm you should create a new folder for your project such as <code>node tutorial</code> and from there initialize it with the command <code>npm init</code></p>
      <p>That will have created a <strong>package.json</strong> file, this is where 3rd party dependencies, scripts, metadata and more are stored.</p>
      <p>Next we will create a node script that we can run. Create a file named <code>index.js</code></p>
      <p>Within this file add the following code<pre><code>console.log('hello world');</code></pre> From the terminal run the following command <code>node index.js</code> You will see <code>hello world</code> output.</p>
