        <h1>Node.js Fundamentals: Chapter 2</h1>
        <h2>Working with Modules and NPM</h2>
        <p>In the previous chapter, we covered the basics of Node.js, including how to write and run simple scripts. In
          this chapter, we'll dive deeper into Node.js by looking at modules and NPM (Node Package Manager), two
          powerful tools that can help us write more complex applications.</p>
        <h3>Modules</h3>
        <p>In Node.js, a module is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates related functionality. Think of it as a
          package of code that can be used in different parts of your application. Modules help keep your code organized
          and modular, making it easier to maintain and update over time.</p>
        <p>To create a module in Node.js, you simply define a JavaScript file and export the functions or variables you
          want to make available to other parts of your application. For example, let's say we want to create a module
          that generates random numbers. We could define a JavaScript file like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">
            // random.js
            function generateRandomNumber() {
              return Math.random();
            }
            
            module.exports = {
              generateRandomNumber: generateRandomNumber
            }
          </code></pre>
        <p>Here, we've defined a function called `generateRandomNumber` and exported it using the `module.exports`
          object. This makes the function available to other parts of our application.</p>
        <p>To use a module in Node.js, we simply require it in our code using the `require` function. For example, if we
          wanted to use our `random` module from above, we could do this:</p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">
            // app.js
            const random = require('./random');
            
            console.log(random.generateRandomNumber());
          </code></pre>
        <p>Here, we're requiring our `random` module and calling the `generateRandomNumber` function to generate a
          random number.</p>
        <p>Node.js comes with a number of built-in modules that you can use in your applications, such as `http` and
          `fs` (file system). You can also create your own modules and publish them to NPM for others to use.</p>
        <h3>NPM</h3>
        <p>NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js that makes it easy to install, update, and manage
          third-party modules in your applications. NPM is included with Node.js, so you don't need to install it
          separately.</p>
        <p>To install a module using NPM, you simply run the `npm install` command followed by the name of the module
          you want to install. For example, to install the `express` module, you would run:</p>
        <pre><code class="bash">
            npm install express
          </code></pre>
        <p>This will download and install the `express` module and all of its dependencies in your project's
          `node_modules` directory.</p>
        <p>Once a module is installed, you can require it in your code just like any other module. For example, to use
          the `express` module in your application, you would do this:</p>
        <h2>Node.js Fundamentals - Chapter 2: Building Web Applications with Express</h2>
        <p>In the previous chapter, we learned how to install Node.js and write a simple "Hello, World!" program. In
          this chapter, we'll take it a step further and learn how to build web applications using Node.js and the
          Express framework.</p>
        <h3>What is Express?</h3>
        <p>Express is a fast, minimalist, and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set
          of features to develop web and mobile applications. Some of the core features of Express include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Routing</li>
          <li>Middleware</li>
          <li>Templating engines</li>
          <li>Error handling</li>
          <li>Static file serving</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these features, Express simplifies the process of building web applications with Node.js.</p>
        <h3>Installing Express</h3>
        <p>To get started with Express, we need to install it. We can do this using <code>npm</code>, which is the
          package manager for Node.js. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.</p>
        <pre><code>$ cd my-project
          </code></pre>
        <p>Next, we need to install Express. To do this, we run the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>$ npm install express
          </code></pre>
        <p>This will download and install the `express` module and all of its dependencies in your project's
          `node_modules` directory.</p>
        <h3>Creating a Simple Web Application</h3>
        <p>Now that we have Express installed, let's create a simple web application. First, we need to create an
          instance of the `express` module:</p>
        <pre><code>const express = require('express');
          const app = express();
          </code></pre>
        <p>The `express` function returns an instance of an Express application, which we have stored in the `app`
          variable. We can now use this instance to create routes and configure middleware.</p>
        <p>Let's create a route that responds with "Hello, World!" when a user visits the homepage:</p>
        <pre><code>app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {
            res.send('Hello, World!');
          });
          </code></pre>
        <p>The `app.get()` method creates a route for the GET HTTP method. The first argument is the path for the route
          (in this case, the homepage), and the second argument is a callback function that is executed when the route
          is matched. The callback function takes two parameters: the request object (`req`) and the response object
          (`res`). In this example, we're using the `res.send()` method to send the "Hello, World!" message to the
          user's web browser.</p>
        <p>Now let's start our server and listen for incoming requests:</p>
        <pre><code>app.listen(3000, () =&gt; {
            console.log('Server started on port 3000');
          });
          </code></pre>
        <p>The `app.listen()` method starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port (in this
          case, port 3000). When the server starts, we log a message to the console to confirm that it's running.</p>
        <p>That's it! We've created a simple web application using Express.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In this chapter, we learned about the fundamentals of Node.js and how to use the Express framework to build a
          simple web application. We covered topics such as creating a basic server, routing requests, handling query
          parameters, serving static files, and using middleware.</p>
        <p>We also briefly touched on some important Node.js concepts such as the event loop, callbacks, and the
          `require` function.</p>
        <p>With this knowledge, you should have a solid foundation to build more complex web applications using Node.js
          and its vast ecosystem of modules and frameworks.</p>
        <p>In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into Express and learn how to use it to build more advanced web
          applications.</p>
