    <h1>Chapter 2: Node.js Fundamentals</h1>
    <p>Now that we've covered the basics of Node.js, it's time to dive deeper into the fundamentals of the platform. In this chapter, we'll take a closer look at the core concepts and features of Node.js, and explore how they can be used to build scalable, high-performance applications.</p>

    <h2>Event-Driven Architecture</h2>
    <p>One of the most important concepts in Node.js is event-driven architecture. In traditional server-side environments, such as Apache, incoming requests are handled synchronously: the server waits for a request, processes it, and then moves on to the next request. In Node.js, however, incoming requests are handled asynchronously, using an event loop that listens for new requests and processes them as they arrive. This approach allows Node.js to handle a large number of requests simultaneously, without blocking the server or causing it to crash.</p>

    <h2>Non-Blocking I/O</h2>
    <p>Another key feature of Node.js is non-blocking I/O. In traditional server-side environments, I/O operations (such as reading from a file or sending data over a network) can block the server and prevent it from processing other requests. In Node.js, however, I/O operations are non-blocking, meaning that they don't block the event loop and allow other requests to be processed in the meantime. This approach helps to ensure that Node.js applications are highly responsive and can handle large volumes of traffic.</p>

    <h2>The Node.js API</h2>
    <p>Node.js provides a rich set of built-in modules and APIs that make it easy to build web applications, handle network requests, and perform a wide range of other tasks. In this chapter, we'll explore some of the most important modules and APIs in Node.js, and learn how to use them to build high-performance applications.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In this chapter, we've explored the core concepts and features of Node.js, including event-driven architecture, non-blocking I/O, and the Node.js API. Armed with this knowledge, you should now be equipped to build powerful, scalable applications using Node.js.</p>
