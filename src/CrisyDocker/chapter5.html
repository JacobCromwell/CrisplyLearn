        <h1>Docker Compose</h1>
        <p>In the previous chapters, we learned how to work with Docker images and containers. In this chapter, we'll take a look at Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.</p>
        <h2>What is Docker Compose?</h2>
        <p>Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you define your application's services, networks, and volumes in a single file, called a Compose file. Then, with a single command, you can start and stop all the services in your application.</p>
        <p>Compose is great for development, testing, and staging environments, as it allows you to easily spin up and tear down multi-container applications on a single machine. It's also useful for deploying applications to production environments, as you can define your application's infrastructure in a Compose file and deploy it to any Docker host with Compose installed.</p>
        <h2>Defining your application with a Compose file</h2>
        <p>To use Docker Compose, you first need to define your application's services, networks, and volumes in a Compose file. Here's an example Compose file:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-yaml">version: '3'
        services:
          web:
            build: .
            ports:
              - "5000:5000"
            volumes:
              - .:/code
            networks:
              - webnet
          redis:
            image: "redis:alpine"
            networks:
              - webnet
        networks:
          webnet:</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, we define two services: a web service and a Redis service. The web service is defined using a Dockerfile (specified by the <code>build</code> directive), and exposes port 5000. We also mount the current directory as a volume inside the container, and attach it to the <code>webnet</code> network. The Redis service uses the official Redis image from Docker Hub, and is also attached to the <code>webnet</code> network.</p>
        <h2>Starting and stopping your application with Compose</h2>
        <p>Once you've defined your application in a Compose file, you can start and stop all the services in your application with a single command:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">docker-compose up</code></pre>
        <p>This command starts all the services defined in your Compose file, and streams their output to your terminal. If you want to run your services in the background, you can use the <code>-d</code> flag:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">docker-compose up -d</code></pre>
        <p>To stop all the services in your application, use the following command:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">docker-compose down</code></pre>
        <p>This command stops all the services and removes their containers.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this chapter, we learned about Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. We learned how to define our application's services, networks, and volumes in a Compose file, and how to start and stop our application using Compose.</p>
