            <h2>Chapter 3: Docker Images</h2>
            <p>Just like a chef uses a recipe to create a dish, Docker uses images to create containers. In this chapter, we'll dive into the world of Docker images and learn how they are used to create containers. Think of Docker images as the ingredients needed to make a recipe, but in the world of software development.</p>
            <p>But wait, why do we need Docker images? Well, imagine having to manually install all the dependencies and configurations needed for your project on every machine it runs on. Not only would that be time-consuming, but it would also introduce a lot of room for error. Docker images solve this problem by providing a standardized way to package all the necessary components into one self-contained unit.</p>
            <p>So, how do we create Docker images? We use Dockerfiles, which are like recipes for building Docker images. In this chapter, we'll go over how to create your own Docker images using Dockerfiles. We'll cover the basic syntax, common instructions, and best practices for writing Dockerfiles.</p>
            <p>Now, let's get started with Docker images!</p>
            <p><strong>Joke:</strong> Why did the Docker container go to the gym? To get in shape for containerization!</p>
